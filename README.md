## About

A full-stack application using the MERN stack, which allows a user to update their information for their digital resume. Work on as a team focused on agile principles and values. We worked two sprints. Our goal for sprint one was to get a visually appealing dashboard of a graduate user, which shows their information stored in a mongo database for the relevant sections. Our goal for sprint 2 was to get a fully functional, tested and editable bio section with a functional form modal.
